# Permaculture Design Management Game

This module is a simulation game that allows players to design and manage a permaculture system. The game aims to educate players about the principles and practices of permaculture, a sustainable approach to agriculture and land management.

## Features

- Interactive map where players can design their permaculture system
- Ability to place various elements such as patches of plants and bigger shrubs and trees on the map. 
- This Tree and shrubs elements have various attributes such as height, width, human usages, ecological system services, etc on it.
- Tools For
    - Cenverting a List of plants to plant data by downloading the data from the Plants for a Future and NaturaDB Web Sites
    - Checking Downloaded Data for Errors
    - Transforming SVG Assets acconding the Plant Data and Scaling acconding your map.
    - Grouping generated SVGs in printable Pages.

## Getting Started

1. Install the PermacultureDesignManagementGame module from the PowerShell Gallery:
`Install-Module -Name PermacultureTreeGuildsDesigner`
2. Call Copy-ExamplePlantNames Command
3. Edit the PlantNames.txt file and add all latin plant names you want to use in your game.
4. Call the ConvertFrom-PlantList command to generate the of SVGs.

## Create your own tree guilds

All tree guilds are defined as SVG files in the assets folder at the module root path.
If you want to create your own tree guilds, you can use the SVG editor of your choice to create your own SVG files. The field within the tree guilds are defined as SVG XML elements. Each of the fields is identified by a unique ID. 

The ID is seperated in 3 sections devided by an underscore. 1 section is the ID prefix, the 2nd section is the Name of the element and the 3rd section is the suffix of the element.

ID prefixes descibes how the element is used.
| Prefix | Description |
| --- | --- |
| t_ | Text element wich contains the text as XML text. The existing text will be replaced by the new text. |
| b_ | Boolean element is of SVG element type path. The visibility of the element will assigned by the changing the style of the element. |
| h_ | Hidden element wich contains other elements amd is of diffent SVG element types. The visibility of the element will assigned by the changing the style of the element. |
g_ | Group element wich contains other elements amd is of SVG element type g. The visibility of the element will assigned by the changing the style of the element.

ID suffixes descibes the SVG element type.
| Suffix | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _text | Text element wich contains the text as XML text. |
| _icon | Icon element wich contains the icon as SVG path. |
| _group | Group element wich contains other elements and is of SVG element type g. |
| _image | Image element, used for hand-drawn elements (raster graphics) |

Here is an list of the fields and their IDs:

### Text Elements

All text elements have t_ as ID prefix and have to be of the element type text.
